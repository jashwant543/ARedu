Students generally face problem in visualizing the concepts, this  application develop better understanding of the subject. 

## Applications
- Book Visualizer: In depth learning of some important concepts of science by visualizing the phenomenon. The image of object or concept in 3D will help students for better understanding of phenomenon. 
- Circuits:3D representation of various circuits for better visualization and understanding of students to make their learning much effective and interactive. 
- Concepts like mathematical equations and graphs, conic sections and visualisation of geometric figures like sphere, cylindrical figures. It will predominantly benefit core topics that include various graphs and 3D curves.
